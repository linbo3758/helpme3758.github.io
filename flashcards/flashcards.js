  { 
    question: "Explain how water's molecular structure leads to hydrogen bonding and how that affects its boiling point and surface tension.", 
    answer: "Water molecules are polar, with a positive hydrogen end and negative oxygen end. This allows hydrogen bonds to form between molecules, increasing boiling point and surface tension." 
  },
  { 
    question: "Describe the process of photosynthesis, including the light-dependent and light-independent reactions.", 
    answer: "Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy. Light-dependent reactions generate ATP and NADPH, while the Calvin cycle (light-independent) uses them to fix CO₂ into glucose." 
  },
  { 
    question: "Discuss the impact of Newton's second law in understanding acceleration and force in various contexts.", 
    answer: "Newton's second law states F = ma. It allows us to calculate acceleration from applied force and mass, explaining motion from car engines to falling objects."
